      <description>Johns Hopkins University have put together a repository containing confirmed cases of COVID19, deaths and recovered patients. Below we plot the confirmed cases, confirmed recovered and deaths.
SIR Model The system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) for the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model is given by
\[\begin{align} &amp;amp; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta I S}{N}, \\ &amp;amp; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta I S}{N}- \gamma I, \\ &amp;amp; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I,\\ &amp;amp; N = S + I + R.</description>

      <description>This blog post aims to introduce the various R packages making up the tidymodels metapackage by classfying Iris flower species from the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is so famous it has its own Wikipedia Page. It consists of measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths and the corresponding species name. A traditional machine learning task is to idetify the species from the other measurements.
The current workflow for a typical classification (or regression) model in tidymodels is:</description>

This includes 2 year colleges which offer associate degrees, certificates and diplomas and 4 year colleges which offer bachelors and masters degrees. These are further split by private institutions, public and for profit. Additionally, Universities in the US charge different tuition fees for in-state or out-of-state students. Also, the ticket price is not always reflective of the students costs.</description>

      <description>The North East Harrier League is a series of cross country running races in the North East of England taking place over the winter from September to March. Results are available online from 2012-13 season to the present season 2019-20. The results are available online in HTML format. I have downloaded and cleaned the data and it can be used for analysis or exploration. The data for senior men and women is available in a tabular format in my blog package - see the file which contains the parsing functions here to get an insight into what it takes to parse this kind of data.</description>

      <description>Poisson Distribution Consider an arbitrary interval where the expected number of events in the interval is denoted as \(\lambda\). The number of events in this interval is Poisson distributed with rate \(\lambda\). To see this, proceed to subdivide the interval into \(n\) smaller intervals \(t_1, \dots, t_n\) in which the probability of an event occurring in each small interval is \(\lambda / n\) and can be represented as an independent Bernoulli trial.</description>

      <description>Forward Mode Automatic Differentation Automatic differentiation can be used to calculate the exact derivative of a function at a point using applications of the chain rule. Dual numbers provide a straightforward implementation in R using S3 generic methods. A dual number has a real component and a “dual” component which can be used to exacly calculate the expression and derivative at a specific value of \(x\). Consider the quadratic form \(f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 10\) with derivative \(f^\prime(x) = 10x + 3\).</description>

      <description>Introduction Determining the posterior distribution for the parameters of a real-world Bayesian model inevitably requires calculating high-dimensional integrals. Often these are tedious or impossible to calculate by hand. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are popular approaches, samplers such as the Gibbs sampler can be used to sample from models with conditionally conjugate specifications and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used when the conditionally conjugate form is not present.</description>

      <guid>https://jonnylaw.rocks/blog/bayesian-linear-regression-gibbs/</guid>
      <description>Linear regression models are commonly used to explain relationships between predictor variables and outcome variables. The data consists of pairs of independent observations \((y_i, x_i)\) where \(y_i \in \mathbb{R}^p\) represents the outcome variable of the \(i^{th}\) observation and \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}\) represents the predictor variable of the \(i^{th}\) observation. The specification for this model is:
\[y_i = \beta^T x_i + \varepsilon_i, \quad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma).\]
The parameters of the model include the coefficients of the predictor variables, \(\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times m}\) and the variance of the unmodelled noise, \(\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}\).</description>

      <description>Setting up the Environment This post uses Almond in order to run Scala code in a Jupyter notebook. See my previous post to learn how to setup Jupyter, Ammonite and Almond. That post examined using the Scala libraries EvilPlot (including inline plotting in the Jupyter notebook) and Rainier for Bayesian inference in a simple linear model.
The imports required for this post are:
import coursier.MavenRepository interp.repositories() ++= Seq(MavenRepository( &amp;quot;http://dl.bintray.com/cibotech/public&amp;quot; )) import $ivy.</description>

      <description>Typically, when programming with Scala I use a combination of ensime in emacs, sbt and the Scala repl. However, sometimes when working on a new project which requires a lot of data exploration and graphics it is sometimes more useful to have a notebook where figures are rendered inline with descriptions of why each figure has been generated and what it shows for future reference. Jupyter notebooks have long been the standard in Python (although I prefer rmarkdown and knitr when using R).</description>

      <description>Coin Flip Model As an example, consider a (possibly biased) coin flip experiment. The parameter of interest is the probability of heads \(p_h\). A Beta distribution is chosen for the prior of \(p_h\), \(p(p_h) = \mathcal{B}(\alpha, \beta)\). The Beta distribution has support between 0 and 1, which is appropriate for a probability. The likelihood of a coin flip is Bernoulli, however the coin should be flipped several times in order to learn the parameter \(p_h\).</description>

      <description>A distribution with an inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be sampled from using just samples from \(U[0, 1]\). The inverse CDF (sometimes called the quantile function) is the value of \(x\) such that \(F_X(x) = Pr(X \leq x) = p\). Consider a that a transformation \(g: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), exists which takes a value sampled from the standard uniform distribution \(u \sim U[0, 1]\) and returns a value distributed according to the target distribution.</description>

      <description>Area Results Download the results from Power of ten for northern, midlands, southern and national.
 A linear model The goal is to fit a model, where the outcome is the position at the national and the input is the position at the northern XC. This then allows us to determine the quality of the field at each XC and determine what position you are likely to finish in the National this season given a result in the area championships.</description>

      <description>Bivariate Normal Model This post considers how to implement a simple Metropolis scheme to determine the parameter posterior distribution of a bivariate Normal distribution. The implementation is generic, using higher-order-functions and hence can be re-used with new algorithms by specifying the un-normalised log-posterior density and a proposal distribution for the parameters. The built-in parallel package is used fit multiple chains in parallel, finally the Metropolis algorithm is reimplemented in C++ using Rcpp which seemlessly integrates with R.</description>

      <description>The Harrier League is a cross country running league with seven fixtures across the North East of England in the 2017/18 season across the winter months from September ’17 until March ‘18.
The Harrier League is unique to other cross country fixtures because the senior runners are divided up into slow, medium and fast packs. In the senior men’s race, the slow runners start first followed 2 minutes 30 seconds later by the medium pack runners, then a further 2 minutes 30 seconds by the fast pack runners.</description>

      <description>There are many sources of open data on the web, freely accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API) made available over the web. A common interchange format for these APIs is Javascript Object Notation (JSON) which is human readable and predictable, however is not in the correct format for analysis. The data needs to be parsed from the JSON string and made available as an object we can work with.</description>

      <description>In this post I will give a practical introduction to some useful structures for handling failure in functional programming.
Referential Transparency One of the most important properties of functional programming is referential transparency and programming with pure functions. This means we can substitute a pure function with its result, for intance if we have the function def f = 1 + 2, we can replace every occurence of f with 3 and the final evaluation will remain unchanged</description>

      <description>The Seasonal DLM I introduced the class of state space models called DLMs in a previous post covering the Kalman Filter. The seasonal DLM is similar to the first order DLM, however it incorporates a deterministic transformation to the state, in order to capture cyclic trends. Remember a general DLM can be written as:
\[\begin{align} y_t &amp;amp;= F_t x_t + \nu_t, \qquad \mathcal{N}(0, V_t), \\ x_t &amp;amp;= G_t x_{t-1} + \omega_t, \quad \mathcal{N}(0, W_t).</description>

      <description>A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) is a special type of state space model, where the state and observation equations are Normally distributed and linear. A general DLM can be written as follows:
\[\begin{aligned} y_t &amp;amp;= F_t x_t + \nu_t, \qquad \nu_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, V_t) \\ x_t &amp;amp;= G_tx_{t-1} + \omega_t \qquad \omega_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, W_t), \end{aligned}\]
\(y_t\) represents the observation of the process at time \(t\), \(x_t\) is the value of the unobserved state at time \(t\).</description>

      <description>Akka Streaming is a streaming IO engine used to build high performance, fault tolerant and scalable streaming data services. In this post I will describe how you can implement some of the features included in Akka Streaming using only simple streams of integers and strings, although the true power of Akka streams only becomes apparent when we are consuming data from real sources such as Websockets, databases and files. Akka is available in Java and Scala, but I will be focusing on the Scala API in this post.</description>
